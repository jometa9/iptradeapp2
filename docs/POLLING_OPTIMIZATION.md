# Polling Optimization - SSE Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the polling mechanisms that were removed or optimized after implementing Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Optimizations

#### 1. `useRealTimeEvents.ts` - Removed Polling
**Before:**
- Polling every 200ms for real-time events
- Long polling with 15-second timeouts
- Complex AbortController management

**After:**
- Removed all polling mechanisms
- Events now handled by SSE in `csvFrontendService.ts`
- Simplified to just client registration/unregistration

#### 2. `TradingAccountsConfig.tsx` - Removed 3-second Polling
**Before:**
```typescript
const quickInterval = setInterval(() => {
  fetchAccounts(false);
  fetchPendingAccountsCount();
}, 3000);
```

**After:**
- Removed polling interval
- Data updates automatically via SSE
- Added console log indicating SSE usage

### Backend Optimizations

#### 1. `events.js` - Deprecated Long Polling
**Before:**
- Long polling endpoint with 500ms intervals
- Complex timeout management
- Multiple interval cleanup

**After:**
- Deprecated `/events/poll` endpoint
- Returns 410 status with message to use SSE
- Redirects users to `/csv/events` for real-time updates

#### 2. `csvManager.js` - Removed Scan Interval
**Before:**
```javascript
scanInterval: 30000,
```

**After:**
- Removed scanInterval configuration
- File watching handled by SSE in real-time
- Added comment explaining the change

## Kept Mechanisms

### Frontend
- **CtraderManager.tsx**: Authentication polling (2-second intervals)
  - This is specific to cTrader OAuth flow
  - Not related to general data updates
  - Should be kept for authentication purposes

### Backend
- **csvRoutes.js**: SSE heartbeat (30-second intervals)
  - Necessary to keep SSE connection alive
  - Standard practice for SSE implementations

- **ctraderApi.js**: WebSocket keep-alive (10-second intervals)
  - Required for maintaining WebSocket connection with cTrader
  - Platform-specific requirement

- **eventNotifier.js**: Event cleanup (60-second intervals)
  - Necessary for memory management
  - Prevents memory leaks from old events

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Server Load**: Eliminated unnecessary polling requests
2. **Better Performance**: Real-time updates via SSE instead of polling
3. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex polling logic
4. **Lower Latency**: Immediate updates instead of waiting for poll intervals
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Less CPU usage and network traffic

## Migration Notes

- All real-time data updates now come through SSE
- Components automatically receive updates without polling
- Authentication flows still use polling where necessary
- Platform-specific connections (cTrader WebSocket) maintain their keep-alive mechanisms

## Testing

After these changes, verify:
1. Real-time updates still work correctly
2. No memory leaks from removed intervals
3. Authentication flows still function properly
4. SSE connections remain stable
5. Performance improvements are noticeable
